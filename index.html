            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <div class="b3i-faq-item">
                <h3>Is Crypto Betting Legal in the UK?</h3>
                <p>Yes, crypto betting is legal in the UK when conducted through properly licensed operators. The UK Gambling Commission doesn't distinguish between payment methods—if the betting site holds a valid license, you can legally use cryptocurrency to bet.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="b3i-faq-item">
                <h3>What Happens if Bitcoin's Price Changes While I'm Betting?</h3>
                <p>Most crypto betting sites convert your cryptocurrency to pounds, euros, or USD at the moment of deposit. Your betting balance is then denominated in fiat currency, protecting you from crypto price volatility while you bet.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="b3i-faq-item">
                <h3>Can I Get Bonuses When Betting with Crypto?</h3>
                <p>Most crypto betting sites offer the same welcome bonuses and promotions to crypto depositors as traditional payment users. Some sites even provide crypto-exclusive bonuses with higher percentages or better terms.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="b3i-faq-item">
                <h3>Are Crypto Withdrawals Really Faster Than Bank Transfers?</h3>
                <p>Yes, significantly faster. Cryptocurrency withdrawals typically process in minutes to hours, while bank transfers take 3-5 business days. This speed advantage compounds when you withdraw frequently.</p>
